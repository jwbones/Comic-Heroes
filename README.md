# Comic-Hero

We are attempting to create a Virtual Reality game using the HTC Vive as the main VR system with the potential to expand to other systems including the Oculus Rift. We began in October of 2018 and expect to complete the project by June of 2019.

Virtual Reality is an expanding platform for the gaming industry that offers players a greater sense of immersing in the game's world. We want to have the players experience a remarkable first-person perspective RPG rather than a third-person 2D game on a screen.

We want to offer this game to game enthusiasts, especially those who enjoy the action/modern fantasy genre. 

Comic Heroes is a Virtual Reality RPG game. The story is based in a small town and revolves around a 15 year old high school student who has a run-in with some mysterious characters. By the end of the day, the student becomes a god-in-training after simulating the powers of a local god. The protagonist is faced with a life-changing decision to accept a stranger's help and become a full-fledged god or be chased and consumed by demons that desire the protagonist's newfound powers. Following the journey of an irregular teenager along with some newly found friends and comrades, will you achieve the status of a true god?
