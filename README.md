We are developing a Virtual Reality RPG game. The story revolves around a 15 year old high school student who has a run-in with some 
mysterious characters. By the end of the day, the student becomes a god-in-training after simulating the powers of a local god. The 
protagonist is faced with a life-changing decision to accept a stranger's help and become a full-fledged god or be chased and consumed by 
demons that desire the protagonist's newfound powers. Following the journey of an irregular teenager along with some newly found friends
and comrades, will you achieve the status of a true god?
